## Description

**AmazingMartin** : A wonderful virtual dressing room application based on GAN

![](./res/logo/logo_banner.png)

Based on the cutting-edge technologies related to **GAN**, such as makeup transfer, hairstyle transfer and virtual try-on, we have built a **virtual modeling room** **application** with complete functions and flexible operation, integrating various functions such as **virtual makeup**, **virtual hair change** and **virtual clothes try-on**. The application allows users to upload model photos freely and combine corresponding functions to meet the personalized needs of them for their modeling preview.

## Installation

We recommend running this repository using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). All dependencies for defining the environment are provided in `environment/environment.yaml`.

Run:

```
cd environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can download all weights from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HWfCEoo3Hen_NkuZ_-UavA) (extracted code: hw96) and put them in ```./checkpoint```.
